# Agentic Workflow

This is an agentic worflow based off of the LangChain Framework, attached to a Streamlit frontend.

## To run:

Within this repo, run `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`

## To Edit:

For sandbox purposes, the jupyter notebook can be modified. If it is, `agentic_workflow.py` must be updated to reflect those changes, since the streamlit app depends on a python file.
